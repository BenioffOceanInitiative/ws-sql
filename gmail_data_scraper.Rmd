## Canadian gmail data scraper ----
reads in and saves email attachments received by autobenioffocean@gmail.com using gmailr 

### set up gmailr
```{r}
gmailr_app <- here("credentials.json") %>%  
  gm_auth_configure(path = .) 
email <- "autobenioffocean@gmail.com"
gm_auth(email = email, path = gmailr_app)
```

### functions
```{r}
# map through all the messages in the latest thread to store any attachments that exist
get_attachments <- function(msg) {
  attachments <- gm_attachments(msg)
  # if attachment exists in message:
  if (nrow(attachments) > 0) {
    file <- gm_attachment(id = attachments$id, message_id = msg$id, user_id = "me")
    # if not test attachment:
    if (attachments$filename != "mtcars.csv") {
      gm_save_attachment(file, here(glue("attachments/{attachments$filename}")))
      base::message(
        glue("saving '{attachments$filename}' from message id {msg$id}"))
    }
  }
}

# map get_attachments across all threads
read_gmail <- function(thread_id) {
  thread <- gm_thread(  
    id      = thread_id, 
    user_id = "me")
  messages <- thread[["messages"]]
  map(messages, get_attachments)
}
```

### read all gmail attachments

# list of threads
threads    <- gm_threads()
threads_df <- threads[[1]][["threads"]] %>%
