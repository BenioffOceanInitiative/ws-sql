Ben,

You had requested access to our historical DMA records awhile back.  Please see the attached files and let me know if you have any questions.

We also have an [interactive DMA app](https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/psb/surveys/interactive-monthly-dma-analyses/), but it hasn't been updated since 2019.
